# m8080

`m8080` is a cycle-accurate Intel 8080 emulator library. It successfully passes every test ROM developed for the original Intel 8080 I could find... and it can run [Space Invaders](examples/invaders.c)!

The library is written as a [single header file](https://github.com/nothings/stb#how-do-i-use-these-libraries) in the style of the stb libraries.
